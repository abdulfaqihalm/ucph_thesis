Transfection was performed by Lipofectamin RNAiMAX for siRNA when HeLa cells were grown to 50% confluence.
For heat shock, MEF cells were grown to 80% confluence in the 6-cm plastic dishes, placed in a 42°C water bath for 1 h, and then recover for 6 h at 37°C. For hypoxia treatment, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence, carried out in Hypoxia Hood which maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, 1% oxygen for 24 h.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK293T, MEF, HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37C

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

Transfection was performed by Lipofectamin RNAiMAX for siRNA when HeLa cells were grown to 50% confluence.
For heat shock, MEF cells were grown to 80% confluence in the 6-cm plastic dishes, placed in a 42°C water bath for 1 h, and then recover for 6 h at 37°C. For hypoxia treatment, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence, carried out in Hypoxia Hood which maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, 1% oxygen for 24 h.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK293T, MEF, HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37C

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.

METTL14 knockdown HeLa cells with GLORI treatment

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

Transfection was performed by Lipofectamin RNAiMAX for siRNA when HeLa cells were grown to 50% confluence.
For heat shock, MEF cells were grown to 80% confluence in the 6-cm plastic dishes, placed in a 42°C water bath for 1 h, and then recover for 6 h at 37°C. For hypoxia treatment, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence, carried out in Hypoxia Hood which maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, 1% oxygen for 24 h.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK293T, MEF, HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37C

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.

Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

Transfection was performed by Lipofectamin RNAiMAX for siRNA when HeLa cells were grown to 50% confluence.
For heat shock, MEF cells were grown to 80% confluence in the 6-cm plastic dishes, placed in a 42°C water bath for 1 h, and then recover for 6 h at 37°C. For hypoxia treatment, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence, carried out in Hypoxia Hood which maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, 1% oxygen for 24 h.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK293T, MEF, HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37C

control knockdown HeLa cells  for siYTHDF2 with GLORI treatment

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.

Transfection was performed by Lipofectamin RNAiMAX for siRNA when HeLa cells were grown to 50% confluence.
For heat shock, MEF cells were grown to 80% confluence in the 6-cm plastic dishes, placed in a 42°C water bath for 1 h, and then recover for 6 h at 37°C. For hypoxia treatment, HeLa cells were grown to 80% confluence, carried out in Hypoxia Hood which maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2, 1% oxygen for 24 h.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
HEK293T, MEF, HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37C

Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.

    <Data-Processing>
Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).
Clean reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR and then transcriptome with bowtie. Pileup was performed using samtools API pysam. Customized scripts were used to call m6A sites from samples.
To make the analysis pipeline easy to implement, we developed GLORI-tools, a computational pipeline that quantifies the A rate of each A site and follows multiple filters for false positives. The code of the GLORI-tools is available in the following GitHub repositories: https://github.com/liucongcas/GLORI-tools.
Assembly: GRCh38/GRCm38
Supplementary files format and content: Sequencing data from parallel untreated RNA-seq samples was used to assess gene expression level. Adapters and low-quality bases were trimmed with trim_galore (version 0.6.6). PCR duplications was removed with Seqkit. UMI were removed with FASTX-Toolkit (version 0.0.13).  The cleaned reads were firstly mapped to the genome with STAR then the transcriptome with bowtie. Uniquely mapped reads were merged and sorted for calculating the expression level of genes. For each gene, reads coverage and gene length was calculated using featureCounts (version 2.0.3), and then RPKM value was calculated with a custom script. Genes with RPKM &lt;1 were excluded from downstream analysis.

    <Pubmed-ID>36302990</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
To investigate the m6A methylation in the mammalian transcriptome, we developed a quantitative method, names GLORI, that could detect m6A stoichiometry at single-base resolution.  We then performed GLORI on cells with different treatment, such as stress, knockdown and inhibitor.
We next analysis m6A methyloms of different  celllines and cells under different treatment to investigate the fuctional role of m6A.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Comparation m6A profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for HEK293T/HeLa/MEF/cells and its KD derivatives (Heatshock, hypoxia, siMETTL3, siMETTL14, siWTAP, siYTHDF2, and inhibition of METTL3).
